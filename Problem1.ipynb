      "There is an inter hostel tournament for AOE (Feel free to choose Quake or CS) going on in IIT Delhi. Each hostel\u2019s team comprises of 4 people.  The organizers (who are students who have played a lot of AOE in IIT but are not allowed to participate in this tournament) are trying to be smart and have chosen to create a new map for the tournament (let\u2019s call it map 1).  They know that each map has its own characteristics and different kind of players perform differently on different maps.\n",

      "To make things easier for the hostels (so that they can choose a team of 4 among 20 students in each hostel), the orgainzers will be doing the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "a.\tThey will be playing on the new map among themselves (assume there are 30 organizers). They will be playing multiple times and will provide a performance index of each organizer for each game p1ij where i is from 1 to 30 and j is from 1 to 1000 (number of games played)\n",
      "\n",
      "b.\tThey will also be providing data of all the other maps and all the other games that have been played in IITD so far. We assume here that all the potential participants have played sufficient number of games. [pkij - where k is from 2 to 10 (for 9 different maps), i is from 1 to n (where 1 to 30 is for organizers  and 31 to n is for the potential participants), j is from 1 to 10000 which are the number of games played]\n",
